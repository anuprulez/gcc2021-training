Below are some suggestions/tips for recording the video tutorials. Note
that these are **just suggestions**, if you prefer something different
that is fine too!

## General

- **It doesn't have to be perfect!!**
- Don't worry if things go wrong in Galaxy or you misspeak etc, this would
  happen during a live workshop too and is totally ok!

## Technical

- Start a Zoom call with yourself, record that.
  - For Mac users, QuickTime Player is also a nice option.
  - Have another preference? Totally ok too!
- Do a short **test recording** first
  - Is the audio quality good enough?
  - **Screen sharing:** is your screen readable? Make sure you **zoom in** enough for it to be clearly visible what you are doing in Galaxy
  - Image this is being viewed in a non-maximised YouTube window. Would it be
    legible? If the participant is using 50% of their screen for the video,
    50% for Galaxy, will it be legible?
- Record in smaller segments if possible
  - E.g per section of the tutorial
  - We can merge the videos together later
  - This will let us define sections in the youtube video as well :)
  - Easier to replace parts of it later if needed (e.g. if you want to reuse
    video for other workshops, and/or decide you want to update parts of the
    tutorial)
- If you are doing both lecture slides and hands-on, please create a separate
  video for each
- Need to edit your video afterwards? (e.g. trimming bits off, putting segments
  together) KDEnlive is easy (but we are also happy to do it for you)

## Content

- **Introduce yourself**
- Give some **background** about the topic
  - Not everybody will be familiar with the topic, so a brief explanation of the important concepts will be useful
- If the tutorial *cannot* be run on all of the usegalaxy.\* servers, make sure
  to mention the **recommended Galaxy server** to use.
- The style of teaching is up to you, but guiding participants through each
  step of the tutorial is often well-received. Explain where you are clicking,
  what parameters mean etc
- **Speak slowly and clearly**
  - Take your time, we are not in a hurry, it's often a lot of new information
    for participants, give them a chance to process all of it
  - Explain exactly where you are clicking in the Galaxy interface, while you
    are doing it.
- **If things go wrong that is ok!**
  - It's educational and makes participants feel less bad if things go wrong
    for them
  - Just explain the steps you perform to figure out what went wrong
- If your tutorial is long, **indicate good places for people to take
  a break** (e.g. when a tool takes a while to run)
- **End:**
  - Remind viewers about the **feedback form** embedded at end of the tutorial
  - If you have any **tips for where to learn more about the topic, or how to
    connect with the community** please share them (e.g. recommended follow-up
    tutorials in GTN, or any external resources, user forums/chat rooms etc)
