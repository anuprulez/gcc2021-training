Below are some suggestions/tips for recording the video tutorials. Note
that these are **just suggestions**, if you prefer something different
that is fine too!

## General

- **It doesn't have to be perfect!!**
- Don't worry if things go wrong in Galaxy or you misspeak etc, this would
  happen during a live workshop too and is totally ok!

## Technical

1. Start a [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) call with yourself, record that.
   - For Mac users, QuickTime Player is also a nice option.
   - Have another preference? Totally ok too!



2. Do a short **test recording** first
   - Is the **audio quality** good enough?
     - Wearing a headset often improves the audio quality.
   - **Screen sharing:** is your screen readable?
     - Make sure you **zoom in** enough for it to be clearly visible what you are doing in Galaxy
     - Imagine this is being viewed in a non-maximised YouTube window. Would it be legible?
     - If the participant is using 50% of their screen for the video,     50% for Galaxy, will it be legible?


3. **Record in smaller segments** if possible
   - E.g per section of the tutorial
   - Easier to update the training later
   - Can merge segments using software like [KDEnlive](https://kdenlive.org/en/)
     - We can also do this for you if needed


## Content


1. **Start of video**
  - **Introduce yourself**
  - Give some **background** about the topic, many participants will be novices



2. The **style of teaching** is up to you, but guiding participants through each step of the tutorial is often well-received. Explain where you are clicking, what parameters and outputs mean, etc



3. **Speak slowly and clearly**
  - Take your time, we are not in a hurry, it's often a lot of new information
    for participants, give them a chance to process all of it
    are doing it.



4. **If things go wrong that is ok!**
  - It's educational and makes participants feel less bad if things go wrong
    for them
  - Just explain the steps you perform to figure out what went wrong



5. If your tutorial is long, **indicate good places for people to take
  a break** (e.g. when a tool takes a while to run)



6. **End of video**
  - Remind viewers about the **feedback form** embedded at end of the tutorial
  - If you have any **tips for where to learn more about the topic, or how to connect with the community** please share them at the end.


7. If you are doing both a lecture and a hands-on training, please created 2 separate videos (unless you prefer to jump back and forth between the two during your session)

**Note:** We will likely run this type of training on a regular basis, so keep this in mind when you are recording, the less you reference this specific event, the easier it is to reuse for other events.

## Video Editing

We can recommend using [KDEnlive](https://kdenlive.org/en/) for this (e.g. for trimming parts of the video, merging segement together).
