**Dates:** June 28 - July 2, 2021, all timezones (24/7 event)

Thank you for teaching a video training session at [GCC 2021](https://www.vibconferences.be/events/gcc2021-virtual-edition)!
This page contains some basic information that is useful
for you as a speaker, and please don't hesitate to contact
Saskia or Helena if you have any further questions!

Would you like to add a training session here? We are still accepting new sessions,
so just let us know!


## Training Format

The GCC training week will consist of video tutorials. Support
will be provided on Slack (chat) and Remo (conference video platform).
There will be a large group of instructors providing 24/7 support, and
you are welcome to invite anybody else to this group of instructors as well.


## Speaker TODOs

As a speaker for the GCC training week, we ask you to:


1. Create/update/check your **training materials**
   - in the [GTN](https://training.galaxyproject.org) if possible, but not mandatory
   - please let us know if you would like help creating GTN materials!


2. Create a **video tutorial** for your session ([guidelines](recording.html))


3. We will send you the auto-generated **captions** (subtitles) for your video. Please go over these and improve them.


4. Fill in a **FAQ document** with common questions about your session


5. Create a **30-second video introduction yourself**
   - We will put all of these together in a "meet your instructors video"


6. **Be online for support** as much as you can during GCC
