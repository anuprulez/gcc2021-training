This course will run non-stop in all time zones, and we will need a lot
of instructors online to pull this off. If you are willing to help out
by answering questions of participants (via chat or video chat), that
would be amazing! thanks!

## Your training as part of this workshop?

There are 2 ways you can do this (you can always change your mind
later):

1. **Video tutorial:** record your training, we will add your training to the
   schedule. You should also be available via Slack during the week of the
   training to help answer questions from participants.
2. **Supported tutorial:** if you do not want to make a video tutorial, but are
   willing to be on Slack that week to answer questions from participants, we
   will add your tutorial to the program as a "supported tutorial"
