First of all, thank you for volunteering to help out with this workshop!
This event is only possible because of our amazing community of
instructors, so **THANK YOU!**

This course will run non-stop in all time zones, and we will need a lot
of instructors online to pull this off. **Instructors** offer support to
participants via chat (Slack) and can start 1-on-1 video calls for
participants to share their screen if useful.

## I would like to help out as an instructor!

To join this event as an instructor, please:

1. Register Here TODO

Some more information about the workshop logistics are listed below, and

## I would like to present a training at this workshop!

Awesome! This workshop will feature numerous modules, where we offer a large number of training sessions, and participants can choose which ones to follow.

Please see the [Speaker Information](for-speakers.html)

## Course Logistics

We will have an instructors call at the end of January, to go over the
course logistics and where you can ask any questions you may have, but
below is some information:

### Slack

We have a [Slack channel]({{ site.config.support_link }})
for the workshop, that we wil use both for communication and preparation
before the course. During the week of the workshop, the participants
will join Slack as well to ask their questions.

**Each training session has a dedicated Slack channel:**

- Participants will ask questions here
- Channels are prefixed by the module and session,
  - E.g. **\#1-1\_galaxy-intro **is the Slack channel for day 1, session 1.
- Instructors can start 1-on-1 video calls with participants
  - Participants can share their screen, if needed
- Each channel has a dedicated FAQ document associated with it (see below)

### FAQ documents

Each training session has a FAQ (frequently asked question) document
associated with it.

- These are pinned to each Slack channel.
  - Access pinned messages via "i" icon on top-right of channel
- **Before workshop:** fill this FAQ document with common questions you anticipate
- **During workshop**: add to this FAQ document
  - If you receive questions that others might have as well
  - This will help both participants, as well as other instructors

### Registration

Registration is not yet open

### Administrative Contact

Instructors, if you notice what you suspect is a server-side issue,
please join/post to the **\#admins** channel for vetting/review. For
confirmed issues, we will notify **\@all** at the **\#instructors**
channel with summary details, status, and potential work-arounds.

*Note*: Please have students try at least ONE rerun for tool failures to
eliminate transient server/cluster issues first. Also keep in mind that
most tool failures, regardless of the reported failure reason stated on
the "bug" icon report or within a red error dataset (the stderr), are
related to input problems. The current problem could also be related to
problems with upstream steps (prior empty results were input, etc). Use
the "rerun" icon and the "i" job details icon to review the original
inputs/settings. Teaching students how to troubleshoot their own
input/parameter issues using rerun/job-details could also be part of
your course.

When reporting technical issues for vetting, please include:

1.  Your \#training-session-channel
2.  The server URL where the issue is presenting

    -   UseGalaxy.org
    -   UseGalaxy.eu
    -   UseGalaxy.org.eu
    -   Other

3.  Full tool name, including the version (copied from the top of the
    tool form)
4.  Or, explain what is going wrong (functionality, other)
5.  A history share link that contains an example error, and note which
    dataset number to review. The rerun should be in that same history.
    Please leave inputs/outputs undeleted.
6.  Include screenshots as appropriate. Please make sure these capture
    the browser URL, the full tool form as executed ("rerun" icon), and
    the expanded input/output datasets in the history panel for the
    quickest feedback.

### After the Workshop

The workshop materials will remain online for people to follow on their
own (until they become too outdated). We will direct questions to our
Gitter channel instead of Slack then.
