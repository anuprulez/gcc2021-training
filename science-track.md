**Schedule:** for this training week we don't have a time-based schedule, instead we provide a set of topical modules for you to choose from. This week YOU make the schedule, YOU decide which tutorials to follow. If you are new to Galaxy, we suggest you start with the *"Introduction to Galaxy"* module, followed by the *"Inroduction to NGS Analysis"* module. If you are unsure which tutorial to follow, feel free to ask for recommendations in Slack!
