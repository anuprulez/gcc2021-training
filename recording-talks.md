Below are some suggestions/tips for recording the video tutorials. Note
that these are **just suggestions**, if you prefer something different
that is fine too!

## General

- **It doesn't have to be perfect!!**
- Don't worry if you misspeak or your demo isn't perfect, this would
  happen during a live event too and is totally ok!

## Technical

1. There are multiple options for recording your talk, but one of the easiest we've found are:
   - Start a [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) call with yourself and record that.
   - For Mac users, QuickTime Player is also a nice option.
   - Have another preference? Totally ok too!


2. Do a short **test recording** first
   - Is the **audio quality** good enough?
     - Not too much background noise?
     - Wearing a headset often improves the audio quality significantly.
   - **Screen sharing:** is your screen readable?
     - If you share your screen at any point during your talk, make sure you zoom
       in enough (usually more than you think is necessary)
     - Participants might be watching on small screens, but they should still be able to see what you are sharing.


## Video Editing

We can recommend using [KDEnlive](https://kdenlive.org/en/) for simple video editing tasks such as trimming
parts of the video, merging seperately recorded segments together, etc.
